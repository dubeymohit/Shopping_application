You need to create a console based (Menu-driven) Shopping Cart application using core python.

Specification:

- Database integration: Postgres SQL.
- User Roles: There are Admin and customer. Admin can enter products and User can browse that products, add to cart and check out them.
- Readme file:  Where you need to provide steps to setup scripts like how to create virtual env and installation of dependent python packages.
- Use Opps concepts in required places.
	
Flow: After run python script, It should ask for login (username and password), if credentials are correct and user is Admin then he can perform following operations:
1. It can see all products and add/delete products.
2. It can see simple reports of Orders (You can use DataFrame here)

# TODO: 
If user id Customer then:
1. Can browse all products.
2. Add products into the cart (Should be able to add multiple products using comma separated product ids)
3. He/She can see order history.
